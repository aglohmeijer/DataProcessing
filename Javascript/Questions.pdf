Javascript Reading Assignment

Difference between '==' and '==='
The difference between the == operator and the === operator is that for the double equal sign (==)
the value/content should be equal. For the triple equal (===) operator the type has to be the equal as well.
Hence three equal signs means 'equality without type coersion (conversion of one type of object to a new 
object with different type but same content as before the conversion)'.

Closure function
In Javascript a closure is an inner function which has acces to variables which for a normal function
would be out of scope. The three scope chains of a closure are its own scope, outer function's variables,
and global variables in the code.

Higher order function
Higher-order functions are functions that operate on other functions (e.g. taking them as arguments
or by returning them).

Query Selector
A querySelector returns elements that matches specific CSS selector in a given document.
We used query selectors a lot in the previous DataProcessing assignments. For example, the line
dom.by_tag('a')[0].content returns the content of the first <a> element in the document 'dom'.
