Question 5
What is a so called “branch” in Git terms and why would you use it?

A branch in git terms is actually a lightweight movable pointer which points to a commit you've done. Initially you create a branch which points to the first commit. When you commit hereafter, the HEAD pointer points to the most recent snapshot of your github repository. You can let the HEAD move to another branch than the masters branch, in that way you diverge your branch history in a way that you actually have two paths of changes being made to your project.
